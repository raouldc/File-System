issues need to be fixed:

multiple blocks for volume info(partially done)
check that there is space for the bitmap shit


multiple blocks for root directory

modify unmount to write multiple blocks for root directory


File psuedo code
first num +1
if file size > 64
	temp = ceil(size/64)
	split into array of 64
check which block to allocate to
first ensure that 
for each file:
	totalsize +=filename+size+blocksize
if > 64
	then split into multiple blocks, starting from num+1
	set bmparray value accordingly

now in the next free slot
	mark "this" slot as filled
	repeat until file is written:
		find next empty block
		write data in that block
		mark "that" block as filled in parent slot directory
		pad with 0's
repeat for all the files
